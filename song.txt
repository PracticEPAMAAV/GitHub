Kill Yourself Part III

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say, "Now get back"
You'll never
See daylight if I'm not strong
It just might

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say, "Now get back"
You'll never
See daylight if I'm not strong
It just might

They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that want to be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head
Turning me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread

I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights makes me violent
I'm trying to get the highest I can get before I overdose and die

My ribs are nothing but an empty cage
Black hole in my chest
Big bang
Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead I will be nothing decomposing in a grave
I'm matter but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve
Gonna have to paint it all
