Kill Yourself Part III

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say, "Now get back"
You'll never
See daylight if I'm not strong
It just might

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say, "Now get back"
You'll never
See daylight if I'm not strong
It just might

They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that want to be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head
Turning me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread

I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights makes me violent
I'm trying to get the highest I can get before I overdose and die

My ribs are nothing but an empty cage
Black hole in my chest
Big bang
Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead I will be nothing decomposing in a grave
I'm matter but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve
Gonna have to paint it all

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say, "Now get back"
You'll never
See daylight if I'm not strong
It just might

Always boasting my emotions
On how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talking
About blowing my head open
'Til the moment you walk in
And find my body motionless

Wrists slit
Thoughts of Slicky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges
'Cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches
Then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world
Until that motherfucker's twitching
Lane switchin', same mission
To die and blame my addiction, bitch

It's not fair, I found love
It made me say, "Now get back"
You'll never
See daylight if I'm not strong
It just might
